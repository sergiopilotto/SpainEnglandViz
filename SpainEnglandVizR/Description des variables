Notes:

    Many columns have missing values (NaN), particularly for event-specific details like blocked coordinates, goal mouth coordinates, and related event/player IDs.
    Columns related to expected threat (xT) models have partial data.
    The dataset includes detailed event information, which can be used for in-depth analysis of match events, player performance, and team strategies.
